# Stock Trading Web App
A stock trading web app built on Flask with an aim to learn about backends. 

- Buy, sell, check price of stocks in realtime
- View portfolio of your stocks
- View history of purchase and sale of stocks

## My Learning Objectives:

I'll be following Miguel Grinberg's Mega-Tutorial practices for structuring my app with my taste sprinkled in some places.

Topics I plan to master ~~by the end of this project~~ as I wander my dev journey:

- [ ] web caching in detail
- [ ] databases, ORMs
- [ ] deployment to cloud
- [ ] cookies, session management
- [ ] authentication, authorization
- [ ] WSGI servers and werkzeug (flask is based on werkzeug)
- [ ] web security - eliminate OWASP top ten security risks from the app 
- [ ] REST APIs in detail - Read Roy Fielding's paper
- [ ] client side validation via JavaScript, AJAX
- [ ] scalability, testing, CI & CD
- [ ] QA

Routes / controllers I need to implement:

- [x] `/register` to register users
- [x] `/login` to provide login mechanism
- [x] `/logout` logs out user
- [x] `/quote` to get a stock's latest price
- [x] `/buy` to buy stocks
- [x] `/index` shows the portfolio of stocks
- [x] `/sell` to sell stocks
- [x] `/history` to see the history of transactions
- [ ] `/api/check/<username>` to allow username validation client side via AJAX

## Quick Development Setup

Fork. Clone. Make sure you `cd` to `stock-trading-app` directory. Set upstream and origin.

Install or update to the latest version of `Python` if you haven't already.

Time to get started. Feel free to create an issue if you get stuck or if you need help :)

```
# Note: execute the below commands in `Bash` with administrative privileges

# Installs pipenv globally
pip install pipenv

# The below command installs dependencies in the pipenv's virtualenv
pipenv install --dev

# Activates virtualenv subshell
pipenv shell

# Copies `sample.env` to `.env`
# You can paste your API credentials in `.env`
cp sample.env .env

# Runs the app, served at http://127.0.0.1:5000 by default
flask run
```
